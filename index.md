### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

Lab 4, Part 2 was my favorite because it was the first program I had comfortably written using basic functions and if statements. The program, Hi-Lo, is a guessing game between two players where the first inputs a secret number into the computer and the second player has two chances to guess the correct number. While writing the code, I learned the purpose of the variables, functions and how to properly format in visual studio through trial and error. In the end, writing this code helped me learn on what I could have improved on my previous labs, breaking down what I am asked in the to-do comments, and understanding the functions and their purpose. 

* Lab 5 

Lab 5, Part 1 is another favorite because it helped me understand what arguments are and how many are in a statement. This lab also taught me how to write statements that counts the number of arguments there are and assign them to a particular order. Since the program focused on making a sandwich, the three elements followed the order of protein, bread, and condiment. The program would then ask the user to type their three ingredients, and if directions were followed, the program would print out “Your order: A *PROTEIN* sandwich on *BREAD* with *CONDIMENT*.” 

* Lab 9

Lab 9, Part 1 is my third favorite as it made me learn how to use input and output functions with statements that required other files. These functions included std::ifstream and outf{filename} to access these files and convert the information into working code. Since the program compiled a list of words for a guessing game, it needed statements that could access specific files and convert the information into words used for the program. While this concept seemed easy to understand, writing it into code took trail and errors to finally have the program functioning properly.
